				<h3 id="headline">Early Life and Education :</h3>
				<ul>
					<li> Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School in Calcutta, and completed his BA in economics
						at Presidency College, Calcutta (then affiliated with the University of Calcutta), though his
						interest was always in the fine arts.</li>
					<li>In <strong>1940</strong> he went to study at Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, founded
						by Rabindranath Tagore. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. He later admitted
						that he learned much from the famous painters Nandalal Bose and Benode Behari Mukherjee.He later
						produced a documentary, The Inner Eye, about Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and
						Elephanta stimulated his admiration for Indian art.</li>
					<li>In <strong>1943</strong>, Ray started working at D.J. Keymer, a British advertising agency, as a
						junior visualiser, earning 80 rupees a month.He really liked visual design (graphic design).
					</li>
					<li> Later, Ray worked for the <strong>Signet Press</strong>, a new publisher started by D. K.
						Gupta. Gupta asked Ray to create book cover designs for the company and gave him complete
						artistic freedom. Ray designed covers for many books, including Jibanananda Das's <i>Banalata
							Sen</i>, and <i>Rupasi Bangla</i>, Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's <i>Chander Pahar</i>, Jim
						Corbett's <i>Maneaters of Kumaon</i>, and Jawaharlal Nehru's <i>Discovery of India</i>. He
						worked on a children's version of <i>Pather Panchali</i>, a classic Bengali novel by
						Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, renamed as <i>Aam Antir Bhepu</i>(The mango-seed whistle).
						Designing the cover and illustrating the book, Ray was deeply influenced by the work. He used it
						as the subject of his first film, and featured his illustrations as shots in his ground-breaking
						film.</li>
					<li>Along with Chidananda Dasgupta and others, Ray founded the Calcutta Film Society in 1947. They
						screened many foreign films, many of which Ray watched and seriously studied. He befriended the
						American soldiers stationed in Calcutta during World War II, who kept him informed about the
						latest American films showing in the city. He came to know a RAF employee, Norman Clare, who
						shared Ray's passion for films, chess and western classical music.</li>
					<li>In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, his first cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a
						son, Sandip Ray, a film director.</li>
					<li>In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray
						helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming
						Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In
						1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at the headquarters. During his six months in
						London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle
						Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which had a profound impact on him. Ray later said that he
						walked out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker.</li>

				<h3 id="headline">Career :</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h5>The Apu years (1950–59):</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>After being "deeply moved" by <i>Pather Panchali</i>, the 1928 classic Bildungsroman of
								Bengali literature, Ray decided to adapt it for his first film. Pather Panchali is a
								semi-autobiographical novel describing the mat.uration of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal
								village.</li>
							<li>With a loan from the West Bengal government, Ray finally completed the film; it was
								released in 1955 to critical acclaim. It earned numerous awards and had long theatrical
								runs in India and abroad. It got very positive reviews along side negative ones in
								country as well as overseas.</li>
							<li>Ray's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, the
								second in The Apu Trilogy, Aparajito (1956) (The Unvanquished). This film depicts the
								eternal struggle between the ambitions of a young man, Apu, and the mother who loves
								him. Upon release, Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing
								Ray considerable acclaim.</li>
							<li>While making Aparajito, Ray had not planned a trilogy, but after he was asked about the
								idea in Venice, it appealed to him. He finished the last of the trilogy, Apur Sansar
								(The World of Apu) in 1959. Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra
								Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta
								house in near-poverty; he becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna. The
								scenes of their life together form "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depictions
								of married life."</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>From Devi to Charulata (1959–64):</h5>Ray followed Apur Sansar with 1960's Devi (The
						Goddess), a film in which he examined the superstitions in Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore
						starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the
						Central Board of Film Certification might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but
						Devi was spared.<br>In 1964, Ray directed <strong>Charulata</strong> (The Lonely Wife); one of
						Ray's favourite films, it was regarded by many critics as his most accomplished.[46] Based on
						Tagore's short story, Nastanirh (Broken Nest), the film tells of a lonely wife, Charu, in
						19th-century Bengal, and her growing feelings for her brother-in-law Amal
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>New directions (1965–82):</h5>n the post-Charulata period, Ray took on various projects,
						from fantasy, science fiction, detective to historical dramas. Ray also experimented during this
						period. He explored contemporary issues of Indian life, responding to a perceived lack of these
						issues in his films. The first major film in this period is 1966's Nayak (The Hero), the story
						of a screen hero travelling in a train and meeting a young, sympathetic female journalist<br>In
						1969, Ray directed one of his most commercially successful films; a musical fantasy based on a
						children's story written by his grandfather,<strong> Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne </strong>(The
						Adventures of Goopy and Bagha).[55] It is about Goopy the singer, and Bagha the drummer, endowed
						with three gifts by the King of Ghosts, set out on a journey to stop an impending war between
						two neighbouring kingdoms
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>Final years (1983–92):</h5>In 1983, while working on Ghare Baire (Home and the World), Ray
						suffered a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of
						his life. Ghare Baire; In 1987, Ray recovered to an extent to direct the 1990 film Shakha
						Proshakha.
